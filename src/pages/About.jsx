          SiteScope is a full-stack web application that helps Colorado residents stay informed
          about local development. By searching with a ZIP code, users can explore what’s being
          built in their neighborhoods — from restaurants and housing to pharmacies and retail.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Why SiteScope?</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
          Most people don’t know what’s being built in their area until construction is already
          underway. SiteScope solves that by making permit data and project summaries more accessible
          and visual — giving you insight before the concrete is poured.
